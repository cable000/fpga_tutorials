# Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC Embedded Design Tutorial

This document provides an introduction to using the Vivado® Design Suite flow for the Xilinx® Zynq|reg| UltraScale+™ MPSoC ZCU102 Rev 1.0 and Rev 1.1 evaluation boards. The tool used is the Vitis™ unified software platform.

The best way to learn a tool is to use it. This guide provides opportunities for you to work with the tools under discussion. Specifications for sample projects are given in the example sections, along with an explanation of what is happening behind the scenes. Each chapter and examples are meant to showcase different aspects of embedded design. The example takes you through the entire flow to complete the learning and then moves on to another topic.

The examples in this document were created using Xilinx tools running on Ubuntu, 64-bit operating system, and PetaLinux on Linux 64-bit operating system. Other versions of the tools running on other Windows/Linux installations might provide varied results. These examples focus on introducing you to the following aspects of embedded design.


[Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoc System Configuration with Vivado](create_system.md) describes the creation of a system with the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Processing System (PS) and the creation of a hardware platform for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. This chapter is an introduction to the hardware and software tools using a simple design as the example.
